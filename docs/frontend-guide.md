## Current State

The frontend is beyond the scaffold stage but not yet feature-complete.

**What's built:**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App shell and routing | ✓ | Main layout, route definitions, public/auth areas configured |
| Landing page | ✓ | Public homepage before login |
| Auth pages | ✓ | Login and registration UI complete |
| Auth infrastructure | ✓ | `AuthContext`, token persistence, session bootstrap |
| Protected routing | ✓ | `RequireAuth` and `RedirectIfAuthenticated` guards in place |
| Shared HTTP client | ✓ | Fetch wrapper with token injection, error handling |
| Feature pages | ⏳ | Dashboard, transactions, budget, bills, savings, household, settings scaffolds exist |
| Feature bindings | ⏳ | Page structure exists but most API integration incomplete |
| UX hardening | ⏳ | Loading, error, and empty states need broader coverage |

**Key note:** The frontend expects `VITE_API_URL` (not `VITE_API_BASE_URL`). The code defaults to `https://localhost:5001/api`, which does NOT match the documented backend at `http://localhost:5000/api`. Always set `VITE_API_URL` explicitly in local development.

## Target State

The finished frontend should:

1. **All pages functional end-to-end**
   - Dashboard shows real month-based summaries
   - Transactions page lists and creates expenses/income
   - Budget page shows limits and spending
   - Bills page displays and allows payment
   - Savings page tracks goals and contributions
   - Household page shows members
   - Settings page available

2. **Consistent UX across all pages**
   - Loading spinners while fetching data
   - Error messages on API failures
   - Empty state guidance when no data exists
   - Form validation feedback
   - Success confirmations on create/update/delete

3. **Reliable auth flow**
   - Token bootstrap at app start
   - Session restored on page refresh
   - Graceful logout
   - Expired token handling (redirect to login)
   - Token refresh mechanism (optional)

4. **Frontend DevX**
   - Type-safe API consumption (DTO alignment)
   - Reusable API client functions
   - Clear error boundaries and retry logic
   - Structured component hierarchy
   - Shared utilities for formatting and validation

## Implementation Sequence

**This is your delivery roadmap.** Complete phases sequentially to unblock dependencies and maintain momentum.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)

1. **Fix API configuration**
   - Set `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api` in `frontend/.env.local`
   - The default `https://localhost:5001/api` is wrong. Silent API failures happen if this is missed.
   - This must be done before any integration work.

2. **Create shared type definitions**
   - Add TypeScript interfaces for all backend DTOs in `shared/types/api.ts`
   - Copy from backend: `User`, `Household`, `Expense`, `Income`, `Budget`, `Bill`, `SavingsGoal`, `GoalContribution`, `Category`, `DashboardSummary`
   - These become the contract. Keep them in sync with backend—mismatch causes bugs at runtime.

3. **Build API service modules**
   - One module per domain: `services/authService.ts`, `services/expenseService.ts`, `services/dashboardService.ts`, etc.
   - Each service exports simple, named functions
   - All errors are routed through consistent handlers (401 → logout, 4xx → form feedback, 5xx → retry)

**Done when:** Dashboard loads real data for the current month.

### Phase 2: Core Workflows (Days 2–4)

4. **Dashboard page** (highest priority)
   - Fetch `GET /api/dashboard/summary?year=X&month=Y`
   - Display income, expenses, net, upcoming bills, savings progress
   - Add month/year selector for browsing past months
   - Foundation for understanding the financial picture

5. **Transactions page** (complex but critical)
   - List all expenses and income in a single view
   - Create new transactions with category selector
   - Edit and delete existing transactions
   - Filter by date range and category (nice to have)
   - This is 70% of user workflows

6. **Bills page** (quick win)
   - List bills with due date and payment status
   - Single action: "Mark as paid" button
   - Optional: show upcoming (unpaid) bills only
   - Simpler than transactions; boost confidence

**Done when:** User can enter transactions, update bills, and see summaries.

### Phase 3: Secondary Features (Days 5–6)

7. **Budget page**
   - Show monthly budgets by category
   - Create new budget (month + category + limit)
   - Display actual vs budgeted spending
   - Optional: visual progress bars

8. **Savings page**
   - List goals with current progress (contributions ÷ target)
   - Create goals
   - Add contributions to goals
   - Optional: show progress as percentage bars

9. **Household page**
   - Display household name and members
   - (Multi-user management not required for baseline)

**Done when:** All core financial workflows are exposed in the UI.

### Phase 4: Hardening (Day 7+)

10. **Consistent UX states**
    - Add `<LoadingSpinner />` component, use on all async operations
    - Add error boundary; show user-friendly errors
    - Add "no data" messaging on empty states

11. **Form validation and feedback**
    - Validate fields before submit
    - Show server errors inline in forms
    - Disable submit during load; prevent double-clicks

12. **Auth robustness**
    - Detect token expiry (401 response)
    - Redirect to login with "session expired" message
    - Add retry logic for transient 5xx errors
    - Handle network failures gracefully

**Done when:** Every page looks finished, loads smoothly, and recovers from errors.

## Module Architecture

This is how to organize code so it scales and stays maintainable.

### Feature Module Structure

Each feature should be self-contained:

```
features/dashboard/
├── pages/
│   └── DashboardPage.tsx          # Route target; fetches and renders
├── components/
│   ├── SummaryCard.tsx            # Reusable pieces
│   ├── TransactionList.tsx
│   └── SavingsProgress.tsx
├── services/
│   └── dashboardService.ts        # API calls only
├── hooks/
│   └── useDashboard.ts            # Fetch logic and state
├── types/
│   └── index.ts                   # Feature-specific types
└── constants.ts                   # Feature constants (labels, etc.)
```

Apply the same pattern to all features: transactions, budget, bills, savings, etc.

### Service Layer (Critical)

**Services are the API boundary:**

```typescript
// services/expenseService.ts
import { request } from "../../shared/api/httpClient";
import type { Expense, CreateExpenseDto } from "../../shared/types";

export const expenseService = {
  list: (token: string) =>
    request<Expense[]>("/expenses", {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    }),
  
  create: (token: string, data: CreateExpenseDto) =>
    request<Expense>("/expenses", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    }),
  
  delete: (token: string, id: number) =>
    request<void>(`/expenses/${id}`, {
      method: "DELETE",
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    }),
};
```

**Never call fetch directly from components.** All API communication flows through services.

### Hook Layer (State + Logic)

Encapsulate fetch logic and state management:

```typescript
// hooks/useDashboard.ts
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { dashboardService } from "../services/dashboardService";
import { useAuth } from "../../auth/hooks/useAuth";

export function useDashboard(year: number, month: number) {
  const { token } = useAuth();
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    dashboardService
      .summary(token, year, month)
      .then(setData)
      .catch(setError)
      .finally(() => setLoading(false));
  }, [token, year, month]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}
```

Components use the hook and focus only on rendering:

```typescript
// pages/DashboardPage.tsx
import { useDashboard } from "../hooks/useDashboard";

export function DashboardPage() {
  const [year, setYear] = useState(2026);
  const [month, setMonth] = useState(3);
  const { data, loading, error } = useDashboard(year, month);

  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (error) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />;
  return <SummaryCard data={data} />;
}
```

This keeps concerns separated and makes testing easier.

## Backend Integration

### Shared HTTP Client

Located at `shared/api/httpClient.ts`. Provides:

- API base URL (from `VITE_API_URL`)
- Request helper with automatic token injection
- Response parsing and error extraction
- API error type with status and message

**Usage pattern:**

```typescript
import { request } from "../../shared/api/httpClient";
import type { Expense } from "../../shared/types";

export const expenseService = {
  list: (token: string) =>
    request<Expense[]>("/expenses", {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    }),
  create: (token: string, data: CreateExpenseDto) =>
    request<Expense>("/expenses", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    }),
};
```

### Integration Rules (Don't Skip These)

1. **Never send `householdId` in request bodies**
   - The backend derives household from JWT claims
   - If you send it, it's ignored (wasted bandwidth)
   - If you try to override it, the request fails silently
   - **Result:** Always comes from the token

2. **Don't import backend DTOs; mirror them in TypeScript**
   - Create types in `frontend/shared/types/api.ts`
   - Keep them in sync with backend responses
   - Use `diff` tools or API test to catch drift
   - **Result:** Type-safe async calls

3. **Route all API calls through feature services**
   - No `fetch` in components
   - No `fetch` in hooks (call services instead)
   - One service per domain (auth, dashboard, expenses, etc.)
   - **Result:** Centralized, testable API layer

4. **Handle 401 responses specially**
   - 401 = token expired or invalid
   - Log out the user immediately
   - Redirect to login page
   - Show "session expired" message
   - **Result:** Users know why they're logged out

5. **Align `VITE_API_URL` with actual backend location**
   - Local: `http://localhost:5000/api`
   - Staging: `https://staging-api.example.com/api`
   - Production: `https://api.example.com/api`
   - Mismatch causes silent failures; use Swagger to debug
   - **Result:** API calls reach the right server

### Environment Configuration

```env
# frontend/.env.local (development)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# frontend/.env.production (before build)
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.example.com/api
```

Without this set correctly, API calls will silently fail or hit the wrong server.

## Next Steps

**Immediate (today):**
- Fix `VITE_API_URL` environment configuration
- Add type definitions for all backend DTOs

**This week:**
- Build API service modules
- Wire dashboard to real data

**Next week:**

- Add consistent UX states (loading, error, empty)

**Polish phase:**
- Auth hardening (token expiry, retry logic)
- Form validation and feedback
- Comprehensive component tests
